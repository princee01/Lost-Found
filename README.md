# 🕵️ Lost and Found Web App

## 📖 Overview
The **Lost and Found Web App** is a frontend-based project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps users post and search for lost or found items with details like item name, description, image, and posting date.  

Currently, the app stores data in the **browser's Local Storage**, ensuring posts remain saved locally for each user.  
In the future, the app can be extended with a full backend and database to support multiple users.
